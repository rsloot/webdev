RESTful apis on all blog pages (json only); <a href=https://ryanslootpy.appspot.com/blog.json>adding .json to end of url</a>. Adding new pages and features. Have a few cron jobs on, one letting me know the new nytimes best sellers each week via text, using Twilio. Will add a page where users can customize and subscribe to digest/texts. Trying to add a recommender that recommends sites/news based on blog posts/friends posts and location using Twitter and Google News.
